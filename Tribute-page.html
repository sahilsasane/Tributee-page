            <p>Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London in 1965. 
            Gaining an early following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, 
            they were distinguished for their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, 
            philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows, and became a leading band of the 
            progressive rock genre, cited by some as the greatest progressive rock band of all time.
            </p>
            <p>Pink Floyd were founded by former Imperial College students Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), 
            Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals), Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals) and 
            Bob Klose (guitars). Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles 
            and the successful debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and 
            vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to 
            deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, 
            devising the concepts behind the band's peak of critical and commercial success with 
            the albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) 
            and The Wall (1979). The musical film based on The Wall, Pink Floyd – The Wall (1982), won two BAFTA Awards.
